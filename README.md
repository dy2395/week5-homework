I have created this website of a task planner for a work day. You can see current day at the top of the calendar and hour blocks from 9 to 17 below.<br/>
Hour blocks in past will be in grey, present in red, and future in green. <br/>
You can type an event in an hour block and save it to local storage by clicking the "Save" button. <br/>
The saved events will persist when you refresh the page.<br/>
